  Data Science 1 Final: Music
  </h1>
<p1>
People are constantly listening to music, whether it be in class, on the bus, or playing video games and the most popular platform to stream music is Spotify. Spotify contains a variety of music, my personal favorite genres are hip hop and alternative rock, by why should spotify care? Well, Spotify has a variety of playlists for all genres of music, so it is important to know what music people are listening to and why people listen to specific genres. So my question is, <mark> what do people enjoy listening to on spotify, and what musical variables influence popular music? </mark> I can answer this question using a database found on Kaggle containing details about an artist, their track name,genre, popularity, and more!
</p1>
  <h2>
    Top 5 music genres
  </h2>
<p2>
We first should determine the top music genres, to narrow down the music a majority of people listen to. So I asked, What are the top 5 music genres by average popularity from each artist on spotify? Using the database, I created a bar graph detailing the top 5 music genres and popularity. To clarify, the popularity rating is on a scale from 0-100 and it is based on the artist,genre, and specific song that is popular. So to begin, I had to find the average popularity rating for each artist and the genre of their song. Once I found the average popularity rating, then created the bar graph seen detailing the top music genres vs popularity. <mark>The most popular genre is dance with a popularity rating of 98, followed by rap, then pop, hip hop, and then reggaeton. </mark>Dance could be the most popular because of the upbeat energy the music brings. And something that could affect the 'feeling' of music is the key signature.

<h2>
  The most popular keys in music
</h2>

<p1>Knowing the most popular genres of music, we can then determine the factors that make a track popular to begin with. Music key signatures are extremely important, and they change how music feels. Music key signatures affect ‘color’ of music, which is completely subjective. However, we can use data to determine the most popular key in music, and maybe that will get us closer to answering our initial question.So I asked again, What are the most popular Keys in music? Using the database I narrowed down each track’s key signature and the varying average popularity of each track and their keys. I then put the information into a bar graph showing the most popular keys. Something to note is, the information that is shown gives us the most popular tracks in terms of likeability, not popularity based on the most used keys.</p>
  
<p1> <mark> C and F are the most common Keys in music, where C is used 12% of the time and F is used 11% of the time. However, these keys are not the most popular subjectively, C# is the most popular key (subjectively), G# is the 2nd and F# is the 3rd. </mark></p>
  
<p1>C# or Db is considered the saddest key in music, in the spotify database, the most popular song with a rating of 100 is “7 Rings” by Ariana Grande and it is in the key of Db.</p>
  
<p1>Within the database there are some holes, the popularity is quite iffy, for lack of a better word. Popularity is based on the track and the artist, the most common key is C, yet it is a key that isn’t even in the top 10 tracks (according to the database). It could be because of the popularity rating, which I will get into later.</p>
  
<p1>Key signatures don’t necessarily determine the ‘sadness’ or happiness’ of a key, it is valence. Valence is a scale that determines the musical positiveness of a track, on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 is the most positive, valence determines the ‘feel’/’emotion’ of a track.</p1>

  <h2>
  Music and Valence
  </h2>
<p1>
  Valence may be the determining factor to why people may rate music highly. So asking another question, is there a correlation between valence and the popularity of a track? Creating a scatter plot with a line of best fit in the middle, I found odd results. I used a Pearson Correlation Coefficient with the data I found. A Pearson Correlation Coefficient measures the relationship between two variables on a scale of -1 to 1 where the closer the coefficient is to 0 the less correlated the variables are. <mark>In the case of popularity versus valence, they have a weak positive correlation coming in at 0.1409.</mark> I expected there to be a stronger correlation because the higher the valence the ‘happier’ the track. <mark>The track with the highest valence in the top 10 tracks was “Sunflower” by Post Malone, with a valence of 0.913, which was 6th in the top 10. Ariana Grande's “7 Rings” had a valence of 0.319.</mark> It seems that valence and popularity aren’t strongly correlated at all.
</p1>

<h2>
  Conclusions
</h2>
<p1>
  Going back to my main question, what do people enjoy listening to on spotify, and what makes an artist popular? People enjoy listening to dance music on Spotify, and it seems popularity could be based on key signature, however, each key signature's popularity ratings are so close, it is difficult to come to a sound conclusion. I also found that valence plays a minimal role in determining if a person enjoys listening to a popular song. So I guess people can still dance to sad music. The database used wasn’t 100% perfect, as there were repeat values that I had to remove. Which ties back into the popularity category. What is ‘popularity’ and how is it measured in this database? Just likeability, listenability? That is something that I couldn’t find on the database, but we do know that popularity is completely subjective, so in a different database I could find different values, however, I chose this database solely due to the amount of data in here, it is up to date and has extremely obscure songs and artists. <mark> Overall, on Spotify people enjoy listening to dance music that is in Db</mark>, where "7 Rings" by Ariana Grande is coincidentally the most popular song in the database. </p>
  <p1>
    Spotify already has a huge collection of specific and popular dance playlists and music artists can take advantage of the popularity and create 'sad' dance songs that can blow up.
