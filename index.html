<h2>Influencer Project</h2>

  <h3> Millions of people around the world have social media accounts. However, social media influencers control and dominate our social media pages. Is there a specific correlation between influencers and how followers rate them? We first need to determine the factors that impact an influencer's influence score. Such as number of followers, Average likes, and the total number of likes an influencer may have. Before we dive into the data, it’s important to note that I am using a database that contains 200 influencers of the top influencers on instagram, their ranks, influencer score, posts, followers, average likes, total likes, and other data that isn’t relevant to our questions.<h3>

  <h2> Influencer Score <h2>
   <h3> Concerning data for just the influencer score, the mean score is 81.85, this denotes the distribution of scores and measures the central tendency, which means most influencers get a B-. The outliers that affect the mean are the max and min, which also denotes the range of the scores. In this case the range is 22-93, where 22 is the lowest score, and 93 is the highest score. The mode score is 85, this tells us that 85 is the most common score that influencers get. The median score is 84, this tells us the score in the middle of the data, which gives us a good scope of the distribution of the dataset. Now, let’s compare the influencer score to the factors that may alter the score.  <h3>

    <h2> Influencer Score VS Number of Followers <h2>
    <h3> Is there a positive, statistically significant correlation between the number of followers an influencer has and their influence score? Cleaning up the unnecessary data, I narrowed down the data to two variables, the influencer score as the independent variable, and number of followers as the dependent variable. Looking at the data for the number of followers I found: the mean is 78,491,000. A six way tie for the mode: 33,600,000,  33,800,000,  36,000,000, 52,900,000,  55,100,000, and  68,100,000. The median is : 50,950,000, and the range is 33,400,000 - 485,200,000. Comparing followers to the influencer score, what we found was that there certainly is a low positive correlation between the variables, and I used a Pearson Correlation to figure this out. A Pearson Correlation Coefficient tells us how closely related two variables are from -1 to 1, in this case the correlation coefficient is 0.365, which is closer to 0 than it is to -1 or positive 1. We can conclude that there is a positive correlation however, it is not statistically significant.<h3>

    <h2> Influencer Score VS Average Likes <h2>
      
    
    <h3> Now let's compare average likes to influence scores, so we can ask: Is there a positive, statistically significant correlation between the average likes an influencer has and their influence score? I narrowed down the data to two variables once more, the influencer score and the average likes. The mean average likes is: 1,785,050 per post. The mode for average likes is 1,100,000 and the median for average likes is also 1,100,000. Finally, the range was from 63,500 to15,400,000. Oddly enough, when I compared the variables to one another, I was able to conclude that there’s a positive correlation but it is extremely weak. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient is 0.048502, meaning that there is little to no correlation between average likes and an influencers score! <h3>

      <h2> Influencer Score VS Total Likes <h2>
      <h3> The next variable to compare to influencer scores is total likes, unlike average likes, total gives us the sum of all likes each influencer receive from all of their posts combined. This value could be comparable to influencer score, since more likes should equal a higher rated influencer. So, is there a positive, statistically significant correlation between the average likes an influencer has on a post and their influence score? I once again narrowed down the data to influencer scores and total likes. The mean total likes is 3,644,949,000, median is 2,050,000,000, and the mode is 1,500,000,000, the range is from 22,800,000 to 57,400,000,000.Just like the average likes, the correlation between total likes and influencer score is positive, but weak, in this case it is stronger compared to the last comparison. The Pearson Correlation Coeffiecient is 0.23498, meaning there’s a weak positive correlation between influencer scores and total likes <h3>

        <h2> Influencer Score VS Total Posts <h2>
      <h3> Finally, we will compare influencer score to number of posts, will there be a positive, statistically significant correlation between the total number of likes an influencer has and their influence score? The mean total posts is 3460.425, the mode is 10,000, and the median is 2100, and the range is from 20 to 16900. As you can see, the data is all over the place, and it is easy to conclude that the correlation between influencer score to posts is weak. The Pearson Correlation Coeffiecient is 0.168287. Oddly enough, there’s a stronger correlation compared to score and average likes. <h3>

          <h2> Conclusion <h2>
      <p> Overall, our findings tell us that there’s no significant correlation between influencer score and any of the variables that we listed. Why is that the case? It may be the popularity of an influencer outside of social media, some “influencers” are actually just corporations, so they receive less likes, but have a higher influencer score than individuals. We also have to take into account what an “influencer score” actually is, who’s opinion is it based off, and how was this data collected? There are also many variables within media that can affect how we look at influencers, controversy, a hiatus, ect. So, I can conclude that influencer score isn’t affected by likes and posts, but it may relate to psychological factors that needs to be considered. <p>
